# Astro Blog Demo

## Overview

As mentioned this is a continuation of the astro blog tutorial demo but integrating Sanity CMS.

A demo of the site can be found [here](https://resilient-pavlova-922456.netlify.app/).

## Bun

With it's initial 1.0 release, decided to have a look to see how it works for development and so far I've encountered no issues with Astro integration. It has many uses and I expect it's adoption to be extensive. The offical documentation can be found [here](https://bun.sh/).

### Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                        |
